//! 平台 Hook（`/platform/hooks/**`，Social 分区的 `/admin/v1/hooks/**`）：经 Capability 的
//! `CapabilityService.Administer` 读写 `tenant_id` 为空的配置，读部署摘要和点位目录，调用一次目标做
//! 测试。
//!
//! 全部只给平台员工。读要求 `core:hooks:read`，写要求 `core:hooks:platform:write`；Capability 再核对
//! 签名里的范围。按 hook_id 的操作和应用路由走同一份实现，范围由 Capability 从配置行判断。
