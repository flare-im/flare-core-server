//! Plugin registry: the three aggregates Core owns whatever sits above it. A deployment without a
//! marketplace still needs them.
//!
//! - [`version`]: `PluginVersion`, an immutable signed package.
//! - [`deployment`]: `PluginDeployment`, the operator's service for a version, and its health.
//! - [`app_state`]: `AppPluginState`, an application's desired and observed state and its
//!   configuration.
//! - [`resolve`]: what the runtime may do, from a projection and these three.
//! - [`reconcile`]: what a convergence pass does with a binding.
//! - [`development`]: a local process in an application flagged for development.
//!
//! Hooks are not here: they are a separate control plane.
